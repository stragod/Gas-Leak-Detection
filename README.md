# Gas-Leak-Detection
A bunch of machine learning algorithms hae been applied to a gas leak data-set and the results are to be compared
A mathematical model has also been made to detect the leak
there are two datasets used..one obtained from a private source and made by ourselves using a common smoke sensor (MQ2)
